# React Text Utils Application
This application provides various text manipulation utilities to help users perform common operations on text. This React application is build using functional components. I have used the React Router DOM a popular routing library for React applications. It provides a declarative way to handle navigation and routing within a React application.

# Features
Text Conversion: Convert text to uppercase, lowercase, sentence case, or title case.
Character Count: Get the total number of characters in the input text.
Word Count: Count the number of words in the input text.
Remove Extra Spaces: Eliminate additional spaces between words.
Copy to Clipboard: Copy the modified text to the clipboard for easy sharing.
